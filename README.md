**Key Features:**

**Product Listing:** Users can view a list of available products, each accompanied by essential details such as name and price.

**Add to Cart:** A prominent "Add to Cart" button accompanies each product listing. Upon clicking, the selected item is seamlessly added to the user's cart without interrupting their browsing experience.

**Cart Page:** The cart page serves as a central hub for managing selected items. It displays a comprehensive summary of all items in the cart, including their names, prices, and quantities.

**Quantity Adjustment:** Users have the flexibility to adjust the quantity of each item directly from the cart page. By increasing or decreasing the quantity, the total amount dynamically adjusts based on the item's price.

**Total Price Calculation:** The cart page provides real-time updates on the total price, reflecting any changes made to the quantity of items. This ensures transparency and helps users make informed decisions.

**Remove Functionality:** Should a user decide to remove an item from their cart, a convenient "Remove" button is available. Upon selection, the item is promptly removed from the cart, and the total price is recalculated accordingly
